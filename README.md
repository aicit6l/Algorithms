# Algorithms

This folder contains various algorithms organized by type. Each folder contains code for different algorithms in a few programming languages.

## Categories:
- **Sorting**: Algorithms that order data (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
- **Dynamic Programming**: Algorithms solving problems by breaking them down (e.g., Fibonacci, Knapsack).
- **Graph Theory**: Algorithms for graph traversal and pathfinding (e.g., BFS, Dijkstra).
- **Searching**: Algorithms for searching data (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search).
- **Recursion**: Recursive solutions to problems (e.g., Factorial, Tower of Hanoi).
- **Divide and Conquer**: Algorithms that break problems into smaller subproblems (e.g., Merge Sort).
- **Miscellaneous**: Other interesting algorithms and problems (e.g., Palindrome Check, Valid Parentheses).

Feel free to explore each folder and see the solutions Iâ€™ve implemented in different languages. ðŸ™‚
